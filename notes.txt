I am given the following assignement:

Background
One of our key goals for 2025 is to improve the way we rank hotels on our search
results page (SRP).
Currently, we manually rank hotels based on various criteria we believe are important.
For example, we prioritize top sellers at the top of the SRP, and every user searching
within the same location sees the same ranking.
Your Task
We’d like you to develop a strategy to optimize our ranking system. As you work
through this, consider the following questions:
● Data: What data would be useful to evaluate and improve the ranking algorithm?
We encourage you to generate dummy data based on what you think is valuable.
● Modeling: What type of model or approach would you recommend for ranking
the hotels? We encourage you to build a model based on this data to showcase
how such a model would help solve this problem.
● Success Metrics: What key performance indicators (KPIs) would you track to
measure success? Would you conduct any experiments to validate the
approach?
● Challenges: What common pitfalls might arise from a data engineering or data
science perspective?
Deliverable
Prepare a set of slides including your analysis addressing the questions above.

I want your help in listing important data points, you can be exhaustive but more
importantly I would like you to explain how you'd go about generating the dummy data.
It's important that we start simple and don't include all possible data points but rather
identify the most important data that would feed a baseline model.
Can you please start listing potential data, and explain why you think that would be 
important to gather for the recommendation model.
